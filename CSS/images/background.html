    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetPaxillus involutus, the common roll-rim, is a fungus widely distributed across the
        Northern Hemisphere; it has also been unintentionally introduced to Australia, New Zealand, and South America. The
        brownish fruit body grows up to 6 cm (2.4 in) high. It has a funnel-shaped cap up to 12 cm (5 in) wide with a distinctive
        in-rolled rim and decurrent gills close to the stalk. Genetic testing suggests that the fungus may be a species complex
        rather than a single species. A common mushroom of deciduous and coniferous woods and grassy areas in late summer
        and autumn, P. involutus is symbiotic with the roots of many tree species, reducing the trees' intake of heavy metals
        and increasing their resistance to pathogens. Previously considered edible and eaten widely in Eastern and Central
        Europe, the mushroom has been found to be dangerously poisonous; in 1944, it killed the German mycologist Julius
        Schäffer. It can trigger the immune system to attack red blood cells with potentially fatal complications, including
        acute renal and respiratory failure. (Full article...) Recently featured: Stretford Indian Head gold pieces Van Diemen's
